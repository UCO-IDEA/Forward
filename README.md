# Forward

**Forward** is a leadership simulation where teams of four work together and use their role-specific skills to get their team to the summit of a challenging mountain. Students will need to communicate with each other as they assess the ever-changing situation, make role-specific decisions, determine how their decisions affect the team, and decide how their team will travel in order to reach the summit safely and on-time.
